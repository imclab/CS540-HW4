Spam Classification with a Naïve Bayes Classifier

One of the famous applications of naïve Bayes classifiers is in spam filtering for e-mail. Can this machine 
learning method be effective in classifying shorter documents, namely SMS messages (text messages) as well? 
You are about to find out.
Your task is to implement a naïve Bayes classifier to identify “SPAM” from “HAM”. The data set you have 
been provided, in the file sms.txt consists of 5,580 text messages that have been labeled as either “SPAM” or 
“HAM”. If you open up the file, you will see that the first word per line is the label while the remainder of the 
line is the text message.
